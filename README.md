# Markdown Blog

Simple Node.js blog that serves Markdown files from the `posts/` folder.

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies

   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the server

   ```powershell
   npm start
   ```

3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. Use "New Post" to add posts.

Notes:
- Posts are stored as `.md` files in `posts/`.
- Titles are taken from the first line (H1) of the Markdown.
