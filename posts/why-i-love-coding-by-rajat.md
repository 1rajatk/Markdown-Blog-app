# Why I love coding — Rajat

Coding gives me the power to turn ideas into working things. I enjoy solving puzzles, learning new libraries, and building small tools that make life a bit easier.

Some reasons I love coding:

- Creativity: you can design solutions and craft experiences.
- Continuous learning: there is always something new to learn.
- Community: sharing knowledge and collaborating improves everyone.

This blog is a place where I'll keep practising and sharing what I learn.
